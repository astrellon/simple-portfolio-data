# Simple Portfolio Data
Data for the simple-portfolio project. See [here](https://github.com/astrellon/simple-portfolio) for how this is used.

The simple version though is that this contains the data for defining pages in the portfolio server and static assets such as images.

The data from here is automatically deployed to the server via a Github [push webhook](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#push).
